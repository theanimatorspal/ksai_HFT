## 🧠 What is ksai_HFT?

A simulation engine where imaginary money moves faster than real emotions.  
Built in C++20, sprinkled with Lua sugar, designed to give you financial chaos at lightning speed.

You get:

| Feature                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📉 Stock Fluctuations    | Totally rational... until they aren’t.                                     |
| 🧠 AI Traders            | Lua-powered chaos monkeys with buy/sell triggers.                          |
| 🔄 Matching Engine       | Orders, priorities, and disappointment – all in one place.                 |
| 🧩 Lua Integration       | Because why not make C++ suffer a little more?                             |
| ⚡ Multithreading        | Faster than you can say “race condition.”                                  |
| 🧪 Market Events         | From GDP releases to alien invasions (okay not yet, but you could).        |
| 🔒 Thread Safety         | We lock mutexes like we lock emotions: under pressure.                     |
| 💥 Stress-Tested         | “Works on my machine” certified.                                           |

## 🛠️ Building ksai_HFT from Source

### Step 1: Install JkrGUI

ksai_HFT visualization is done using JkrGUI, you have to install it. Goto https://github.com/theanimatorspal/jkrgui. You have to properly setup JkrGUI.

### Step 2: Clone the Chaos

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ksai_HFT.git
cd ksai_HFT
```

---

### Step 3: Let CMake Do the Thinking

#### 🪟 Windows (Visual Studio)

```bash
cmake -B out/build/VS -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build out/build/VS --config Release
```

#### 🐧 macOS (Ninja)

```bash
cmake -B out/build/Ninja -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build out/build/Ninja
```

## 🧩 Lua + C++ = ♥️?

Yes. Lua controls the logic. C++ does the heavy lifting.  
Want to pause the simulation mid-panic? Lua can do that.  
Want to make a trader that only buys on Mondays? Lua can do that too.

> ☕ Write once, crash everywhere.
